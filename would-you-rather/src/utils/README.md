# Would You Rather Project

This is the starter code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

This project allows the user to add new questions and to answer existing questions and see the answer poll and the leaderboard.

## To download:

You can download the zip files from this Github repo, then open your terminal, and follow these steps in order:

* `cd` into the `would-you-rather` folder
* run `npm install` inside the terminal
* then run `npm start` and you should see the page open in your browser!
